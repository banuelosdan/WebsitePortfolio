    <h3>My Educational Journey</h3>
    <p>I graduated from High School in 2016, without any idea of what I wanted to do in life.
      My parents never grew up in an educational home, but wanted to change that for myself and my siblings.
      I am the third oldest child of four. I have two older brothers who attended college, so I felt
      that I should do the same.
    <p>Still unaware of what I wanted to study, I blindly attended my local community college.
    There I was able to venture into some of my interests. I was always fond of
    Mathematics and Science, though I never delved into it much more than that. In my time at SBVC
    I focused primarily on completing general math and science courses, hoping that I would take interest into
    something less vague. It wasn't until my fourth semester there, I decided to major in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>After my fourth semester at SBVC, I applied to CSUF and was admitted for the Fall of 2018.
    I had only taken one CPSC course at my CC, so I was completely new to the subject. I had no prior education
    experience, nor had I ever looked into it during my own time. It was an abrupt decision. Eventhough I feel
    behind in a lot of my classes, I enjoy learning the topics and every semester I seem to be learning even more
    material than the last. I am happy with my career choice and the destination I chose to pursure it.
    </p>
    <p>Cal State Fullerton has been an amazing school that has taught me a lot about being a better student.
    I am now in my fourth year as a college student, and my second here at CSUF. I've since taken numerous
    courses that have made me a better Programmer. I have also met great Professors, who are willing
    to take time out of their day to teach me new things.</p>
    <p>As it currently stands, I am expected to graduate in the Spring of 2021 with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
      I am close to the finish line, but I know I still have a long way to go, event after graduation, before I
      can be a great Programmer. I have so much to learn, but I am having the time of my life doing it.
    </p>
    <h3>Career Ambitions</h3>
      <p>One of the main factors that persuaded me into majoring in Computer Science was because of my
        interest in video games. So, naturally, I studied CS in hopes of one day becoming a Game Developer. Though
        now that I've been in the CS field for a few years. I understand how unlikely that is. Although, it isn't
        entirely impossible. But I mention this because, eventhough, game development was the only reason
        I decided to major in CS, now that I've studied it for a while, I am actually open to a lot of jobs that
        CS offer. From software development, to networking, to cybersecurity, or web development my range if interest
        has widened tremendously.
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, as it now stands, I do not have my sights locked in on a specific job title, I am hoping
        that my electives will help me broaden my search. But, I am open to any internships that can come my way to
        really understand how it feels to work as a programmer.
