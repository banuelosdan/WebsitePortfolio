      <h2>Assignment 1: Memorandum</h2>
      <p><a href="Assignments/CPSC311_Homework1.pdf" download>
        <img src="Images/image1.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 1 was the first assignment of CPSC 311 at CSUF. It was an
          individual assignment. For this assignment
          I had to write to my boss of a fictitious company and persuade them why
          I deserve a promotion. I argue why I would be better suited to the company
          as a technical writer. In the memorandum, I provide details about my
          skills and the importance of technical writing in the work environment.
          I give personal skills aside from work that will be benefical and skills
          that have culminated in the work force. My skills are more fit for the
          technical writing position for the company.
          </p>
        <p>Technical Writing is the importance of this course and for our first
          assignment we were assigned to research the benefits and properties
          of techincal writing. I learned how to properly use tags such as headers
          and how to modify the text without using direct formatting.
          </p>
        <p>This was the first assignment, so naturally, there was a lot of forgiveness.
        Although, I did learn from my mistakes and prioritized formatting for my
        future papers and presentations.

          <img src="Images/image2.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 2 was the first group assignment. My group consisted of 3 members:
          Steven, Kevin, and myself. We were assigned to create a student handguide
          for new students. We were advised to give special insight information
          that only current students or alumn would know about the campus to
          aid the new students. We divided the work into three sections: Quality
          of Life, Resources, and Academic Aid.
          </p>
        <p>For this project we had to utilize several techniques we had learned
          in the course. We had to make sure to utilize formatting techniquies
          as well as writing techniques. We used several methods of structuring our
          information like outlines and bullet points. The goal of this
          assignment was to use deductive writing to quickly give out information.
          </p>
        <p>This assignment was our first group assignment, so the grading
          was still a bit lenient. One thing I learned from this was to use
          properly create an outline and use hyperlinks to direct the user
          to certain areas of the paper.

        <h2>Assignment 3: Group Research Project</h2>
        <p><a href="Assignments/CSUF-Project2.pdf" download>
          <img src="Images/image3.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 3 was the second group assignment. My group consisted of 3 members:
          Steven, Kevin, and myself. This assignment was a research project. We chose
          to research Arduino boards. We researched what the Arduino Boards are, how
          they are used, then we compared the boards to other MCU's on the market.
          </p>
        <p>For this project we had to utilize several techniques we had learned
          in the course. We had to make sure to utilize formatting techniquies
          as well as writing techniques. Some of the writing technique we had to use
          was ABC format. ABC format is a writing layout that states what will be said,
          then we prove our statements, then we state it again. We also used
          deductive reasoning in our writing style.
          </p>
        <p>This assignment was graded a bit more seriously. One thing I learned from this
          assignment was how to use tags and how to format paragraphs. Prior to this
          assignment, I was still directly formatting my work, thinking I was
          using indirect formatting. I also took away some useful writing advice from
          this assignment. Such as structuring topics and using subheaders.

          <img src="Images/image4.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 4 was the third group assignment. My group consisted of 3 members:
          Steven, Kevin, and myself. This assignment revolved around an Ethics lecture.
          We were given an ethical dilemma and had to use four ethical theories. We
          backed up our reasoning with Kantian, Egoism, Virtue, and Utilitarian ethics.
          </p>
        <p>For this project we had to have a clear understanding of each of the four theories
          and apply them to the dilemma. This assignment was lenient on formatting.
          We had to prioritize the content and make sure our reasoning was true to
          the ethical theory.
          </p>
        <p>I learned about various ethical theories and how you can apply them
          given that you use the correct reasoning. This assignment was graded purely on the
          content and I learned how important it is to communicate with the group
          members because if one person does not understand the theory, everyone is
          marked for the mistake.

          <img src="Images/image5.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 5 was the fourth group assignment. My group consisted of 3 members:
          Steven, Kevin, and myself. This assignment was another assignment revolving around
          a bias lecture. The assignment was to find four fallacious arguments each. And apply which
          fallacy they used.
          </p>
        <p>For my four arguments I used: Red Herring, False Equivalence, Burden of Proof,
          and Correlation Causation. I used Twitter and Reddit to find my arguments.
          Finding arguments then analyzing whether they used fallacious reasoning
          proved to be troublesome.
          </p>
        <p>I learned a lot from this assignment. Again we did not need to
          prioritize the formatting of the text as much as we normally do. Rather,
          for this assignment we had to have a strong understanding of numerous
          fallacies and elaborate on our reasoning to showcase our knowledge on the
          topic.

          <img src="Images/image6.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 6 was the fifth and final group assignment. My group consisted of 3 members:
          Steven, Kevin, and myself. This assignment was a presentation. We had to present
          our research paper on Arduino boards. This assignment was informed to us by the
          professor to be practice for the Final.
          </p>
        <p>For the presentation each of us were given approximately 2 minutes to cover
          the portion of the paper we researched. I was in charge of the comparison
          of Arduino boards to other MCU's. No extra work was necessary, all we had to
          do was convert our paper into a presentation, while still using ABC format
          and deductive writin.
          </p>
        <p>This presentation was a good warm-up for the Final presentation. We had a chance
          to work of our performance skills, which include speech, eye-contact, readiness, and
          overall knowledge of the topics. I made sure to utilize the feedback from
          this assignment and implement it into my Final. We lacked a concise structure
          and styling of our presentation.

          <img src="Images/image7.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 7 was the second individual assignment. The prompt of the Midterm
          was the same as assignment 3, I had to choose a topic related to Computer Science
          and research it. I chose to conduct my research on Printed Circuit Boards. I wrote about
          what PCB's are, the efficiency of the boards, and the environmental impact
          the boards have. I go into great detail in each of the topics and provide insight
          into newer technology.
          </p>
        <p>At this point of the semester, I had completed several assignments and
          was well-informed on how to successfully format my papers. As well as understanding
          how to use the various writing techniques to help the reader digest copius
          amounts of information. As well as cutting the paper into small portions
          of information to help the flow of the paper and also to keep the reader invested.
          </p>
        <p>This assignment was good practice to employ all the skills I've culminated in the
          semester into one assignment. From styling to formatting, to writing, I used every skill I know.

        <h2>Assignment 8: Final Presentation</h2>
        <p><a href="Assignments/Final.pdf" download>
          <img src="Images/image8.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 8 was the final for the course. Each individual had to present for approximately
          10 minutes. The purpose of the presentation was to persuade the audience whether
          the city of Detroit should implement a new City Park or new infrastructure for
          a new Tech. Company.
          </p>
        <p>I took the position of the Park. For the presentation I had to conduct research on
          Detroit as well as the effects of Parks and the effects of Infrsatructure renewal.
          After researching the three topics I was confident in my argument why Detroit
          would benefit most out of a Park. If you download the file, you will see my
          persepective and my reasoning for the park.
          </p>
        <p>The Final assignment was a good assignment to test evey aspect of the course.
          We are tested on our formatting skills and ability to create a cohesive document of information.
          Our researching skills are also tested, along with our presentatve appearance, and ability
          to successfully persuade an audience without using fallacious reasoning. Overall, I
          learned a lot from this course, and learned very useful techniques which will
          aid me in an educational and professional environment.
