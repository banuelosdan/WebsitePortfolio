      <h2>Assignment 1: Group Software Project</h2>

          Assignment 1 was the first group assignment of CPSC 362 at CSUF. For this assignment
          our group had to deliver an elevator pitch of a software that we wanted to create.
          My group decided to create a FPS video game that utilizes mazes. The game encourages
          the player to play aggressive or stealthy.
          </p>
        <p>The importance of this assignment was to get to know the members of the
          group and decide the what to do for the semester-long group project.
          </p>
        <p>The group assignment taught me a lot about working with groups in an AGILE
          setting. It helped emulate and uderstand software engineering. Through this process
          I also learned alot about Unity and game designing.

        <h2>Assignment 2: Designing Service App</h2>
        <p><a href="Assignments/Assignment2.doc" download>
          <img src="Images/image2.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 2 was the first individual assignment.The purpose of this assignment
          was to dissect the requirements needed to build a servicing app that
          provides the user the ability to order food/drinks.
          </p>
        <p>In this assignment I learned how to apply requirement engineering to get
          an abstract level of what components are needed to build the app. Then
          I applied different software models to define the requirements in further detail.
          I used the Use-Case Model and UML Diagrams. Then afterwards, I implemented
          3 architecture models to understand the data flow of the app. I used Data Flow Architecture,
          Layered Architecture, and Object-Oriented Architecture.

        <h2>Assignment 3: Continuation of Service App</h2>

          <img src="Images/image3.png" alt="W3Schools" width="164" height="202"></a>
          Assignment 3 was the continuation to Assignment 2. In this assignment
          I had to provide more depth in the architecture that I employed in Assignment 2.
